# Research

StreamInterop is based on research including the following projects:

- amphp/byte-stream: https://github.com/amphp/byte-stream (amphp)
- aphiria/io: https://github.com/aphiria/io (aphiria)
- fzaninotto/streamer: https://github.com/fzaninotto/Streamer (fzan)
- hoa/stream: https://github.com/hoaproject/Stream (hoa)
- kraken-php/stream: https://github.com/kraken-php/stream (kraken)
- psr/http-message: https://github.com/php-fig/http-message/blob/master/src/StreamInterface.php (psr)
- react/stream: https://packagist.org/packages/react/stream (react)
- zenstruck/stream: https://github.com/zenstruck/stream (zenstr)

    - _ReadableStream_
    - _ResourceStream_
    - _WritableStream_
- fzan:
    - _Stream_
- hoa:
    - _In_ ("readable")
    - _Out_ ("writable")
    - _Pointable_ ("seekable")
    - _Stream_
- kraken:
    - _StreamBaseInterface_
    - _StreamReaderInterface_
    - _StreamSeekerInterface_
    - _StreamWriterInterface_
- psr:
    - _StreamInterface_

    - _Stream_

## PHP Function Equivalents

These PHP functions have equivalent methods in the respective projects.

function                                     | amphp | fzan | hoa | kraken | psr | react | zenstr |
-------------------------------------------- | ----- | ---- | --- | ------ | --- | ----- | ------ |
`fclose()`                                   | X     | X    | X   | X      | X   | X     | X      |
`feof()`                                     |       |      | X   |        | X   |       |        |
`fread(int $length)`                         |       | X1   | X   | X1     | X   |       | X      |
`fwrite(string $data, int $length)`          | X2    | X    | X   | X2     | X2  | X2    | X      |
`rewind()`                                   |       | X    | X   | X      | X   |       | X      |
`fseek(int $offset, int $whence = SEEK_SET)` |       | X    | X   | X      | X   |       | X      |
`ftell()`                                    |       |      | X   | X      | X   |       |        |
`stream_get_meta_data()`                     |       | X    | X   | X      | X   |       | X      |
`stream_get_contents()`                      |       | X1   | X3  | X1     | X   |       | X3     |

1. fzan and kraken use `fread(?int $length)`, where null indicates an equivalent `stream_get_contents()`

2. amphp, kraken, psr, and react omit the `$length` parameter

3. hoa as `readAll()`, zenstruck as `contents()`

Notably, the projects almost never use `false` as a return value to indicate failure; they almost always throw an exception of some sort instead.

## Other Affordances

These are some of the other affordances or their equivalents commonly defined in their respective projects.

`__toString()` (convert stream to string) |       |      |     |        | X   |       | X      |

`isSeekable()`                            |       | X    |     | X      | X   |       | X      |
`isWritable()`                            | X     | X    | X   | X      | X   | X     |        |

1. psr as `detach()`, zenstr as `get()`

## Exceptions

On these error conditions or their equivalents, these exceptions are thrown by these projects:
